### Patch Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/pull/82) [`e49beb2`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/e49beb28551ef11b66a158ad2fcac4a5242edb44) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Fixed a bug where prettier was not found in the server bundle, causing an irrecoverable error on startup.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a1c9de6`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/commit/a1c9de6ab1130159da5f59f399869ebbfeaa4281) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Allowed for parsing and rewriting inline implementations in the VSCode extension. This allows you to use either named actions (which were already supported):

  ```ts
  createMachine({
    entry: ["sayHello"]
  });
  ```

  Or inline actions:

  ```ts
  createMachine({
    entry: [
      () => {
        console.log("Hello!");
      }
    ]
  });
  ```

  Both can now be handled in the VSCode extension. This is true for inline actions, services and guards.
